        Added details() method to determine why an address check fails.
          Thanks to Otis Gospodnetic for the suggestion.      
        Global Net::DNS::Resolver object is now used for DNS queries when
          Net::DNS is available.  Can be accessed directly to tweak the
          resolver behavior.
        The address() method now returns an additional value (an instance of
          the Mail::Address class) when called in a list context.  
        Updated documentation.

        Moved test.pl to t/valid.t as suggested by Achim.
        DNS lookups now use Net::DNS if available, falling back to nslookup if

        Modified documentation
        Renamed Email::Valid::NSLookup to Email::Valid::DNS, which is now
          responsible for all DNS queries.
