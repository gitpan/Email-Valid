DESCRIPTION

  This module determines whether an email address is well-formed, and
  optionally, whether a mail host exists for the domain or whether
  the top level domain of the email address is valid.

PREREQUISITES

  This module requires perl 5.004 or later and the Mail::Address module.
  The Net::DNS module is required for DNS checks.   

  Either the Net::DNS module or the nslookup utility are required 
  to perform DNS checks.

  The Net::Domain::TLD module is required to check validity of top level
  domains.

  Under Win32, the module tests take a very long time, so be patient.
 
INSTALLATION

  To install this module, move into the directory where this file is
  located and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

  This will install the module into the Perl library directory.  If 
  you lack sufficient privileges for this, then you can specify an
  alternate directory like this:

        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/where/I/want/it/put
        make
        make test
        make install

  Once installed, you can use the following line to load the module into
  your scripts:

        use Email::Valid;

  If you installed the module into an alternative directory, you will
  need to let Perl know where it can be found:

        use lib "/path/to/my/modules";
        use Email::Valid;

  See the POD documentation for further details.
